# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Flask

## 📌 Overview
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning-based web application that estimates the risk of heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The project utilizes Flask to serve the trained model and provide a simple yet effective user interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on input parameters.
- Machine Learning model trained on healthcare datasets.
- Flask-based backend for seamless integration.
- Interactive web interface for user-friendly predictions.
- Real-time inference and result display.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Deployment:** Flask (Locally or on Cloud)

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing key health metrics like:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Heart Rate
- Diabetes Status
- Other relevant medical parameters
